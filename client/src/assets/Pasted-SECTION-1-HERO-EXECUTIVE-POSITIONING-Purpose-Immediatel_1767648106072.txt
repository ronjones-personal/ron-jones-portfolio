SECTION 2: LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY
Purpose

Establish trust, seniority, and operating style.

Content
Leadership Philosophy

I am a hands-on, lead-by-example operator. My job is to block and tackle for my teams, remove friction, and ensure they can execute at a high level without noise or ambiguity.

I believe the best leaders stay close enough to the work to understand reality, but far enough back to see patterns. I spend time in discovery calls, deal reviews, onboarding sessions, and customer escalations, not to micromanage, but to ensure the system is working.

Across my career, teams I’ve led have consistently shortened sales cycles, increased deal size and win rates, improved adoption and renewal outcomes, and earned trust with executive stakeholders.

My role is to build durable systems, develop strong leaders, and create environments where execution is predictable and outcomes are repeatable.

SECTION 3: ORIGIN STORY / HUMANIZING THROUGHLINE
Purpose

Humanize without losing executive credibility. Explain why you lead this way.

Content
Curiosity as a Throughline

I’ve always been curious about how things work.

Growing up, I was the kid taking things apart to understand them, even when I couldn’t always get them back together. That included my first computer. At the time, it was frustration and trial-and-error. In hindsight, it was early reverse engineering.

That instinct never went away. It evolved.

What started as curiosity became an engineering foundation, then expanded into software, systems, automation, and eventually organizations. Today, that same mindset shows up in how I lead teams and solve problems. I want to understand the system beneath the surface, where it breaks down, and how to rebuild it so it works better for everyone involved.

Whether I’m modernizing GTM motions, restructuring a team, automating a manufacturing workflow, or remodeling a house end-to-end, the pattern is the same: learn the system, challenge assumptions, rebuild with intent, and execute.

That curiosity is still the driver. The difference now is experience, discipline, and the responsibility to turn insight into outcomes for teams, customers, and businesses.

SECTION 4: SOLUTIONS ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP
Purpose

Speak directly to CROs and sales leadership.

Content
Solutions Engineering Leadership

I build Solutions Engineering organizations that act as a revenue multiplier, not a support function.

My focus is on outcome-driven discovery, executive-level technical storytelling, repeatable demo and POC frameworks, disciplined qualification, and clean handoffs into implementation and Customer Success.

Across multiple organizations, I’ve standardized SE motions that increased POC-to-paid conversion by up to 40%, improved win rates by over 20%, reduced sales cycle time, and materially improved forecast accuracy.

I partner deeply with Sales, Product, and Engineering to ensure what we sell is what customers can successfully adopt.

SECTION 5: CUSTOMER SUCCESS LEADERSHIP
Purpose

Speak directly to CEOs, COOs, and Heads of CS.

Content
Customer Success Leadership

I operate Customer Success as a growth engine.

I have owned the full customer lifecycle across onboarding, implementation, adoption, renewal, and expansion. My approach centers on accountability, operational rigor, and relentless focus on customer outcomes.

I have built and scaled CS, PS, and post-sales SE organizations, improved platform utilization by over 20%, standardized QBR and renewal-readiness frameworks, converted pilots into paid implementations, and established VoC programs that directly influenced product and GTM strategy.

Customers should experience one company, not a collection of teams. My role is to make that real.

SECTION 6: RJJ SOLUTIONS – INDEPENDENT CONSULTING
Purpose

Credibility amplifier. Shows depth, judgment, and builder DNA.

Content
RJJ Solutions, Independent Engineering and Systems Consulting

Since 2018, I have operated RJJ Solutions alongside executive leadership roles, providing selective, high-impact consulting across engineering, automation, and systems modernization.

This work reflects my builder mindset and my ability to operate independently at a senior technical and strategic level.

Expert Witness and Product Design Consulting

I have served as an expert witness for plaintiff-side consumer product design cases, providing rigorous technical analysis, documentation, and testimony under legal scrutiny.

Hydrogen Injection Prototype, Government Innovation

I contributed to the development of a prototype hydrogen injection system designed to power internal combustion engines using hydrogen, targeted toward government agency use cases. This work focused on applied innovation, rapid prototyping, and system-level engineering.

Enterprise Automation, Industrial Manufacturing

For a dock manufacturer with approximately 75 employees and $25M in annual revenue, I led the modernization of their internal design and engineering workflows.

The result:

30% increase in production capacity

15% reduction in per-job cost

We replaced a fully manual, legacy process with a quote-to-build system that automatically generated designs, bills of materials, and production-ready outputs, feeding directly into shop floor fabrication.

SECTION 7: TECHNICAL SKILLS (EXECUTIVE-CURATED)
Purpose

Signal hands-on credibility without overwhelming.

Content
Technical Skills and Tooling

I maintain an active technical skill set that informs how I lead teams, evaluate architecture, and partner with Product and Engineering.

Languages and development

Python

JavaScript

SQL

API design and integration

Automation and data

Business process automation

Data pipelines and transformation

ETL and normalization workflows

Legacy system modernization

Infrastructure and tooling

Docker for personal and experimental projects

Local and cloud-based development environments

Rapid prototyping and POC tooling

I use technology pragmatically. Tools are a means to outcomes, not the goal.

SECTION 8: PERSONAL → HOBBIES → RENOVATION
Purpose

Humanize while reinforcing the builder mindset.

Content
Builder Mindset, Renovation Projects

I have remodeled four houses end-to-end, completing full renovations that included framing, electrical, plumbing, cabinetry, kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, and finish work.

These were full system rebuilds, not cosmetic updates.

Renovation mirrors how I approach leadership and software: understand the system, identify structural weaknesses, rebuild with intention, and execute with accountability.

This work reinforces craftsmanship, sequencing, and respect for execution. It also feeds my constant curiosity and high motor. I am always learning, building, and improving.
