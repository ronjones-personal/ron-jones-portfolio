🔹 GLOBAL LAYOUT CHANGES

Maintain a single long-scroll page

Reintroduce boxed / card-style sections for:

Professional Experience

Hobbies

Key Value Areas

Optimize for 30-second executive skim

Reduce paragraph density where possible

POV terminology only, never POC

🔹 SECTION 1: HERO (REWRITE)
Replace the hero section word for word with the following:

Headline
Senior Leader building Solutions Engineering and Customer Success organizations that drive durable growth.

Subheadline
Customer-facing executive leader with 15+ years scaling enterprise SaaS, data, integration, and regulated-market platforms. Known for leading from the trenches, aligning GTM teams, and turning complex technology into repeatable business outcomes.

Replace existing metrics with these four only:

Enterprise GTM leadership across Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, and Professional Services

Proven success in complex, multi-stakeholder enterprise sales and delivery cycles

POV-to-production conversion improved by up to 40 percent

Teams and systems built to scale adoption, retention, and expansion

Primary CTA
Let’s talk

🔹 SECTION 2: LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY (KEEP, SLIGHTLY TIGHTEN)

Keep this section, but ensure it remains no more than two short paragraphs and is visually separated with whitespace.

🔹 SECTION 3: ORIGIN STORY (KEEP AS-IS)

Keep “Curiosity as a Throughline” unchanged. It’s working and humanizes you well.

🔹 SECTION 4: PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (RE-ADD, BOXED)
This section should be reintroduced as boxed experience cards, not long prose.
Section Title
Professional Experience

Each role should be represented as a clean card with:

Company

Title

Date range

3–4 impact bullets max

Use the following summary-level bullets (not full resume copy):

Coherent
Senior Leader, Solutions Engineering & Client Strategy

Led pre- and post-sales technical strategy across enterprise insurance clients

Built scalable POV and delivery frameworks improving conversion and time-to-value

Partnered cross-functionally to align Product, Sales, and CS around outcomes

Totango
Senior Director, Solutions Engineering & Customer Success

Built and scaled global SE, CS, and PS teams

Increased enterprise win rates and deal size through value-driven engagement

Standardized onboarding, adoption, and renewal readiness

Trimble
Director, Solutions Engineering

Led enterprise and federal GTM technical strategy

Transitioned services-heavy motions into scalable software-led growth

Recognized with multiple leadership and performance awards

RJJ Solutions
Principal, Independent Consulting (Ongoing, Selective)

Provided executive advisory and hands-on engineering across automation and modernization

Led quote-to-build transformation increasing production 30 percent and reducing cost 15 percent

This section should feel credible, fast, and skimmable, not exhaustive.

🔹 SECTION 5: RJJ SOLUTIONS (KEEP, SHORTEN)

Keep the RJJ Solutions narrative, but trim redundancy. Ensure metrics remain visible and bolded.

🔹 SECTION 6: TECHNICAL SKILLS (KEEP CONCISE)

This section should remain a tight, grouped list, not a paragraph.

🔹 SECTION 7: PERSONAL → HOBBIES (RESTORE BOXES)
Rename Section
Curiosity Outside of Work
Restore boxed layout, with one box per hobby area.

Use the following box titles and descriptions:

DIY & Home Renovation
End-to-end home renovation projects including framing, electrical, plumbing, cabinetry, kitchens, and full system rebuilds. A practical extension of my builder mindset.

Drone & Aerial Photography
Exploring perspective, planning, and precision through aerial photography and videography.

3D Printing, Modeling & Design
Hands-on experimentation with design, prototyping, and physical iteration.

Home Coding & Automation Projects
Personal projects using Docker and related tooling, including home media servers and automation systems built to learn, test, and optimize.

Life Outside Work
Time spent with my dogs, which keeps me grounded and balanced.

Each box should be:

Visually consistent

Short

Easy to scan

Optionally clickable to expand or show images

🔹 SECTION 8: FINAL CTA (KEEP SIMPLE)

End the page with:

If you are building or scaling Solutions Engineering or Customer Success and need a senior leader who can operate in the trenches and at the strategic level, let’s talk.

🔹 FINAL UX NOTES

This page should read cleanly at three speeds:

10-second skim

30-second scan

2-minute read

Boxes and cards are critical for this

Avoid long vertical text blocks
