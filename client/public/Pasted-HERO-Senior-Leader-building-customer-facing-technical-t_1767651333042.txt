LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY

I am a hands-on, lead-by-example operator.

My job is to remove friction, block and tackle for my teams, and ensure they can execute without noise or ambiguity. I stay close enough to the work to understand reality and far enough back to see patterns.

I focus on building durable systems, developing strong leaders, and creating environments where outcomes are predictable and accountability is clear.

CURIOSITY AS A THROUGHLINE

I’ve always been curious about how things work.

As a kid, that meant taking things apart to understand them, often without getting them back together. That included my first computer. At the time it was trial and error. Looking back, it was early reverse engineering.

That instinct never went away. It evolved.

Today, it shows up in how I lead. I want to understand the system beneath the surface, where it breaks down, and how to rebuild it so it works better. Whether I’m modernizing GTM motions, restructuring teams, automating workflows, or building physical systems, the pattern is the same: understand, simplify, rebuild, execute.

SOLUTIONS ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP

I build Solutions Engineering teams that act as a revenue multiplier, not a support function.

Outcome-driven discovery tied to business impact

Executive-ready demos and technical narratives

POV frameworks with clear exit criteria

Clean handoffs into implementation and Customer Success

Field-to-product feedback loops that improve what we sell

The goal is simple. What we sell must be adoptable, defensible, and repeatable.

CUSTOMER SUCCESS LEADERSHIP

I operate Customer Success as a growth engine.

Onboarding and adoption frameworks that accelerate time-to-value

Renewal readiness, QBR discipline, and forecasting clarity

Executive alignment across complex stakeholder groups

VoC programs that influence roadmap and GTM priorities

Expansion driven by measurable outcomes, not promises

Customers should experience one company, not a collection of teams.
