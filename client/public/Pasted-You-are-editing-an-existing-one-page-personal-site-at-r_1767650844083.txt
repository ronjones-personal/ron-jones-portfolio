You are editing an existing one-page personal site at ronaldjones.me. The goal is to improve executive skim-ability, restore scannable proof, and use boxed layouts to break up content. Do NOT add new pages. Everything remains on ONE long page.

GLOBAL REQUIREMENTS

ONE long-scroll page only

Use clean executive styling, generous whitespace, strong typography

No stock photos. Only user-provided photos

Use POV everywhere. Never use POC

Use boxed cards for Professional Experience and Hobbies

Dogs appear ONLY in a bottom “Life Outside Work” section, not inside hobby cards

Optimize for 3 reading speeds:

10-second skim (headings, cards, metrics)

30-second scan (bullets, key metrics)

2-minute read (short paragraphs)

SECTION ORDER (FINAL PAGE FLOW)

Implement sections in this exact order with clear section anchors:

Hero

Credibility Strip (metrics row)

Leadership Philosophy

Curiosity as a Throughline (origin story)

Solutions Engineering Leadership

Customer Success Leadership

Professional Experience (cards, timeline style)

RJJ Solutions (consulting)

Technical Skills (grouped lists)

Curiosity Outside of Work (Hobbies cards)

Life Outside Work (Dogs + photos)

Final CTA / Contact

SECTION 1: HERO (REPLACE ENTIRE HERO COPY)

Replace hero headline and subheadline with EXACT text:

Headline:
Senior Leader building Solutions Engineering and Customer Success organizations that drive durable growth.

Subheadline:
Customer-facing leader with 15+ years across enterprise SaaS, data, integrations, and regulated markets. Known for leading from the trenches, aligning GTM teams, and turning complex technology into repeatable business outcomes.

Hero layout requirements:

Headline large, bold

Subheadline smaller, max width, easy to read

CTA buttons directly under text:

Primary button: “Let’s talk”

Secondary button: “View experience”

CTA buttons should scroll to Contact and Professional Experience sections

SECTION 2: CREDIBILITY STRIP (NEW, BOXED METRICS ROW)

Immediately under the hero, add a horizontal row of 4 metric cards. Each card has:

Small label

Bold value statement (no dollar amounts)

1 short supporting phrase

Use EXACT text below:

Card 1
Label: Enterprise outcomes
Value: Win rates and deal outcomes improved
Support: Through value-led discovery and POV execution

Card 2
Label: POV conversion
Value: Up to 40% lift in POV-to-production
Support: Defined exit criteria and repeatable frameworks

Card 3
Label: Team scaling
Value: Built and scaled SE, CS, and PS teams
Support: Hiring, enablement, playbooks, operating rhythm

Card 4
Label: Execution systems
Value: Predictable delivery and renewal readiness
Support: Standardized onboarding, QBRs, and health signals

Design notes:

These should be real “cards” with a subtle border or shadow

Equal height

Stack to 2x2 on mobile

SECTION 3: LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY (KEEP, BUT REPLACE COPY)

Replace this section’s body copy with EXACT text:

Leadership Philosophy

I am a hands-on, lead-by-example operator. My job is to block and tackle for my teams, remove friction, and ensure they can execute at a high level without noise or ambiguity.

I stay close to the work, not to micromanage, but to understand reality. I spend time in discovery calls, deal reviews, POVs, onboarding sessions, and customer escalations to ensure the system is working as intended.

My role is to build durable systems, develop strong leaders, and create environments where execution is predictable and outcomes are repeatable.

Formatting:

Keep to 3 short paragraphs

Add whitespace between paragraphs

SECTION 4: ORIGIN STORY (KEEP, REPLACE COPY)

Replace with EXACT text:

Curiosity as a Throughline

I’ve always been curious about how things work.

Growing up, I was constantly taking things apart to understand them, often without successfully putting them back together. That included my first computer. At the time, it was frustration and trial-and-error. In hindsight, it was early reverse engineering.

That instinct never went away. It evolved.

What started as curiosity became an engineering foundation, then expanded into software, systems, automation, and eventually organizations. Today, that same mindset shapes how I lead teams and solve problems. I want to understand the system beneath the surface, identify where it breaks down, and rebuild it so it works better for everyone involved.

Whether I’m modernizing GTM motions, restructuring teams, automating workflows, or building physical systems, the pattern is the same: learn the system, challenge assumptions, rebuild with intent, and execute.

SECTION 5: SOLUTIONS ENGINEERING LEADERSHIP (ENSURE POV TERM)

In this section:

Replace any “POC” or “proof of concept” with “POV” or “proof of value”

Keep it short, 4 to 6 bullets max

Use bullets not paragraphs

Add these bullets if missing (exact text):

Outcome-driven discovery tied to business impact

Executive-ready demos and technical narratives

POV frameworks with clear exit criteria

Clean handoffs into implementation and CS

Field feedback loops to Product and Engineering

SECTION 6: CUSTOMER SUCCESS LEADERSHIP (BULLET FORMAT)

Use bullets not paragraphs. Include (exact text):

Onboarding and adoption frameworks that drive time-to-value

Renewal readiness, QBR discipline, and forecasting clarity

Executive alignment and multi-threaded stakeholder management

VoC programs that influence roadmap and GTM priorities

Expansion motions grounded in measurable outcomes

SECTION 7: PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (RESTORE, CARD/TIMELINE FORMAT)

Create a “Professional Experience” section with a 2-column layout on desktop and 1 column on mobile.

Each role must be a card with:

Company (bold)

3 bullets max, short and outcome-oriented

Use EXACT card content below (do not add more bullets):
